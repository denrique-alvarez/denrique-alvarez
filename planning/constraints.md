# Constraints

_Some boundaries around our project._

## External

<!--  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:  - project deadlines  - UI design or color schemes  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)-->

- Planning documents should be ready by 19th November.

- Issues ready on the project's board by 22nd November.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:  - each of your individual skill levels  - amount of time available to work on the project-->

- I won't use JS.

- I will use only HTML and CSS.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:  - coding style & conventions  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository  - the number of hours you want to spend working  - only using the colors black and white-->

- I will stick to the format, linting and all checks established.

- The project will be developed for mobile and then gradually enhanced.
