## Description

This is a project permanently under construction. The more resources and skills
I gain over time, the more features and and improvements this site should have.
So basically this project comes to showcase my growth as a developer and to let
people know a bit about me.

Web development is at the core of what I do now, but it's not the only thing.
However, I will try to keep it simple and interest for those whose interests
are in technology. We are still in Github after all, right?

For now I will be using mostly HTML and CSS, trying to apply some design
principles giving that part of my knowledge a chance to speak for me and go from
there. Java and improved designs are coming.

## Contribution

Open to contributions/suggestions. PR's are welcome if they help me improve some
feature or visual :)
