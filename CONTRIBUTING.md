# Contributing to Daniel's Homepage

I would like to hear from you and get some good constructive feedback. I doesn't
matter what it is:

- Reporting a bug.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a fix.
- Proposing new features.

## We Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

Send your PR's to:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make sure your code lints. Formatting is important.
3. Issue that pull request!
