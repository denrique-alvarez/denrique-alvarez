# Module Retrospective

## Personal

<!-- How did you do in this module? -->

I think this module is particularly intense because of the nature of the topic
and the amount of technicalities related to it. I am doing ok but it will take
time before all the info starts to sink in.

### What was not clear, where did you get stuck?

I would say picking a good starting point has been a bit challenging.

### What was clear, what did you master?

I have a general understanding of the basic elements and logic.

### Where can you still use some help?

Just practicing and repeating all the concepts in different types of situations
would be really helpful at this point.

### Where can you help others moving forwards?

I think trying to help others right now is too risky (for that person). Maybe in
the future I could try to introduce certain ideas to other students.

Not much. Mostly individual work this time but @Darin-Hamouda was really helpful
explaining certain aspects of variables and how programming works in general.

Not much. Just trying to help @colevandersWands with some feedback and general
questions about the best way to organize and present certain parts of the
module's content.

@Darin-Hamouda explained to me a good deal about variables and what that means
